# Yaso
[![Ruby](https://github.com/ar2em1s/yaso/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/ar2em1s/yaso/actions/workflows/main.yml) ![gem](https://img.shields.io/gem/v/yaso) [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/ar2em1s/yaso)](https://github.com/ar2em1s/yaso/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)
