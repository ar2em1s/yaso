# Yaso
[![Ruby](https://github.com/Ar2emis/yaso/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/Ar2emis/yaso/actions/workflows/main.yml) ![gem](https://img.shields.io/gem/v/yaso) [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Ar2emis/yaso)](https://github.com/Ar2emis/yaso/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)

That's my (Yet Another) ServiceObject pattern implementation. I made it fast ([the fastest of this kind actually](https://github.com/Ar2emis/yaso/wiki/Benchmarks); [simple_command](https://github.com/nebulab/simple_command), you got me this time) and simple to use (I hope). I was inspired by those alternatives and I hope this will encourage them to be even better:
- [Trailblazer](https://github.com/trailblazer/trailblazer)
- [Decouplio](https://github.com/differencialx/decouplio)
